# Spotify App 🎶  

The **Spotify App** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that mimics the functionality of the Spotify music streaming platform. Users can explore music, listen to songs, and search for their favorite tracks, albums, and artists, offering an immersive music experience.

## 🌟 Features  

- **User Authentication:**  
  Users can sign up, log in, and manage their account, including authentication via JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  
- **Song Playback:**  
  Play, pause, and skip songs, mimicking a real music streaming platform with a built-in audio player.

- **Playlist Management:**  
  Create, manage, and add songs to personal playlists.

- **Album and Artist Pages:**  
  Display detailed pages for albums and artists with their respective songs and albums.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Fully responsive and accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** React.js for building a dynamic user interface, handling state management, and rendering components efficiently.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for building the RESTful API that interacts with the frontend and MongoDB database.
- **Database:** MongoDB to store user data, songs, albums, playlists, and more.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
- **APIs:** Custom APIs for music data, integrated with the backend to fetch music-related data.
